<h1 align="center" style="border-bottom: none">Node Template Project</h1>
<h3 align="center" style="border-bottom: 1px solid #808080; padding-bottom: 16px;">Basic template to start your next node project</h3>

The purpose is to have a template to use any node project with the latest dependencies and best practices.

This template will **not include** any framework, only will have the necessary tools to have a excellent workflow and DX for a basic node project; it's up to you if you want to extend the project installing any framework.
